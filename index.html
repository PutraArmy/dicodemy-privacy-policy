      <h1>Privacy Policy - DICODEMY</h1>
      <p>
        DICODEMY ("we", "our", "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how our mobile application collects, uses, and protects your personal data. By using our app, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. This policy complies with Google Play Store requirements and ensures transparency for users.

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>Our application collects the following types of data to provide core functionality:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Location Data:</strong> We collect precise location data to deliver essential features such as navigation, geofencing, and location-based notifications. Accessing location data in the background is crucial for the proper functioning of these features, even when the app is not actively in use.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect data about your device such as device model, operating system, and app version to optimize performance and resolve technical issues.

        <li>
          <strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information regarding how you interact with our app, including feature usage and performance metrics, to improve user experience.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
      <p>The information we collect is used to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide location-based services, such as navigation and alerts, even when the app is not in active use.</li>
        <li>Ensure the app functions correctly on various devices and operating systems.</li>
        <li>Enhance app features and personalize user experience.</li>
        <li>Maintain the security of your data and our application infrastructure.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Background Location Access</h2>
      <p>
        Our app requires access to your location data in the background to offer continuous services such as navigation, geofencing, and location-based notifications. This access is essential for delivering the core functionality of the app. Importantly, any location data collected is processed locally on your mobile device and is not transmitted or shared with any third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How We Address Compliance:</strong> We follow Google Play Store guidelines regarding background location access, ensuring that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Location access is only enabled when it directly relates to essential app features.</li>
        <li>Users are clearly informed when background location access is requested, and the purpose is transparently communicated.</li>
        <li>Permissions can be managed or revoked at any time through the device settings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not share, sell, or trade your personal information with third parties without your consent, except in the following cases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We may share data with trusted third-party service providers who assist us in operating the app, provided they agree to keep the information confidential.</li>
        <li>If required by law, we may disclose your data to comply with legal obligations or protect the rights and safety of our users and the public.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take the security of your personal information seriously. We implement industry-standard security measures such as encryption and secure storage to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, please be aware that no method of data transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain your personal data only for as long as is necessary to provide the services described in this Privacy Policy or as required by law. Once the data is no longer needed, it will be deleted or anonymized to ensure privacy.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        You have the right to access, correct, or delete the personal information that we collect. You can manage location permissions directly through your device settings, including enabling or disabling background location tracking. If you choose to disable location access, certain features of the app may not function as intended.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our services are not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected data from children, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.
